# Auklet Releaser

Command `releaser` takes a deployable binary and a debuggable binary, checks to
make sure they're "the same program" and that the debuggable binary is actually
debuggable, then creates a release object in the backend if the pair of binaries
is releasable.

## Usage

Specify the instrumented binary to be deployed, the binary that contains debug
info, the app ID, and the API key.

	./releaser -deploy deployfile -debug debugfile -appid appid -apikey apikey

## Functionality

The `deployfile` and `debugfile` ELF binaries must meet the following criteria:

1. `debugfile` must contain a DWARF table and an ELF symbol table
2. `deployfile` and `debugfile` must have identical ELF sections, except for those
   which are changed by executing `strip`

If the criteria are satisfied, a release should be created. Otherwise, an error is
generated.

The assumption is that a `deployfile` would be generated by first creating an
ELF with debug info, then stripping it out:

	gcc -g main.c -o debuggable
	cp debuggable stripped
	strip stripped

Binaries created in this way should be releasable.

A release object, at minimum, should consist of

- program name
- release version
- checksum of the deploy binary
- ELF symbol table
- DWARF data
